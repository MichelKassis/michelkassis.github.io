**App Description:** Android application to facilitate the simulation of circuits.
    Allowing users to take a picture of a schematic circuit (Hand-drawn/Printed) and detecting all circuit elements and values to then simulate the circuit and generate its netlist.
**Responsible For:**
    -Built Convolutional Neural Network model using Tensorflow(Python) to classify circuit elements. Integrated in app using Java
    -Integrated OpenCV for Object Detection with Tesseract OCR Engine to detect Hand-drawn text and symbols accurately.
